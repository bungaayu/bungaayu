### Hi, I'm BungaðŸ‘‹

I have an interest in quality assurance, even though I had not studied this in college, after graduating from college I decided to take part in a bootcamp with a concentration in quality assurance engineering. after doing the bootcamp, I am increasingly interested in quality assurance and will continue to study it until I make it my field of work. Wish me good luck!
