### Hi, I'm BungaðŸ‘‹
<br>

Thank you for visiting my page!
<br> I have an interest in Quality Assurance. After graduate from Sriwijaya University, I decided to take part in Alterra Academy bootcamp with a concentration in Quality Assurance Engineering. After doing the bootcamp, I am increasingly interested in Quality Assurance and will continue to study it until I make it my field of work.
<br> Wish me good luck!âœ¨
