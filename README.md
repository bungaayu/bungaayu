### Hi, I'm BungaðŸ‘‹
<br>

Thank you for visiting my page!
<br> For now, I have an interest in quality assurance, even though I had not studied this in college, after graduating from college I decided to take part in a bootcamp with a concentration in quality assurance engineering. After doing the bootcamp, I am increasingly interested in quality assurance and will continue to study it until I make it my field of work. Wish me good luck!
<br> Wish me good luck!âœ¨
